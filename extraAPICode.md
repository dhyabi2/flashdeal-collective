# Node.js Code for Additional API Endpoint

This code implements the additional API endpoint for retrieving a specific deal by its ID, as described in `extraAPI.md`.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Assuming you have a deals array or database connection set up
const deals = []; // This should be replaced with your actual data source

// Get Deal by ID
router.get('/api/deals/:id', (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  
  // Find the deal with the matching ID
  const deal = deals.find(deal => deal.id === id);
  
  if (deal) {
    res.json(deal);
  } else {
    res.status(404).json({ error: "Deal not found" });
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

To use this endpoint:

1. Make sure you have Express.js installed in your project:
   ```
   npm install express
   ```

2. In your main server file (e.g., `app.js` or `server.js`), include this route:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const dealRoutes = require('./path/to/this/file');

   app.use(dealRoutes);

   // ... rest of your server setup
   ```

3. Replace the `deals` array with your actual data source (e.g., database query).

4. Ensure proper error handling and input validation in a production environment.

This implementation allows clients to fetch a specific deal by its ID, which is useful for displaying shared deal details.
